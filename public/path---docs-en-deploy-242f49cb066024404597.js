You may also want to share that Storybook with the team, especially the non-technical members. Thankfully, it‚Äôs easy to deploy Storybook online.</p>\n<div class="aside">\n<strong>Did you setup Chromatic testing earlier?</strong>\n<br/>\nüéâ Your stories are already deployed! Chromatic securely indexes your stories online and tracks them across branches and commits. Skip this chapter and go to the <a href="/conclusion">conclusion</a>.\n</div>\n<h2>Exporting as a static app</h2>\n<p>To deploy Storybook we first need to export it as a static web app. This functionality is already built into Storybook, we just need to activate it by adding a script to <code>package.json</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-javascript">{\n  "scripts": {\n    "build-storybook": "build-storybook -c .storybook -o .storybook-static"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now when you build Storybook via <code>npm run build-storybook</code>, it will output a static Storybook in the <code>storybook-static</code> directory.</p>\n<h2>Continuous deploy</h2>\n<p>We want to share the latest version of components whenever we push code. To do this we need to continuous deploy Storybook. We‚Äôll rely on GitHub and Netlify to deploy our static site. We‚Äôre using the Netlify free plan.</p>\n<h3>GitHub</h3>\n<p>First you want to setup Git for your project in the local directory. If you\'re following along from the previous testing chapter jump to setting up a repository on GitHub.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-bash">$ git init\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next add files to the first commit.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-bash">$ git add .\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now commit the files.</p>\n<pre><code class="language-bash">$ git commit -m "taskbox UI"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Go to GitHub and setup a repository <a href="https://github.com/new">here</a>. Name your repo ‚Äútaskbox‚Äù.</p>\n<p><img src="/github-create-taskbox.png" alt="GitHub setup"></p>\n<p>In the new repo setup copy the origin URL of the repo and add it to your git project with this command:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-bash">$ git remote add origin https://github.com/&#x3C;your username>/taskbox.git\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally push the repo to GitHub</p>\n<pre><code class="language-bash">$ git push -u origin master\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Netlify</h3>\n<p>Netlify has a continuous deployment service built in which will allow us to deploy Storybook without needing to configure our own CI.</p>\n<div class="aside">\nIf you use CI at your company, add a deploy script to your config that uploads <code>storybook-static</code> to a static hosting service like S3.\n</div>\n<p><a href="https://app.netlify.com/start">Create an account on Netlify</a> and click to ‚Äúcreate site‚Äù.</p>\n<p><img src="/netlify-create-site.png" alt="Netlify create site"></p>\n<p>Next click the GitHub button to connect Netlify to GitHub. This allows it to access our remote Taskbox repo.</p>\n<p>Now select the taskbox GitHub repo from the list of options.</p>\n<p><img src="/netlify-account-picker.png" alt="Netlify connect to repo"></p>\n<p>Configure Netlify by highlighting which build command to run in its CI and which directory the static site is outputted in. For branch choose <code>master</code>. Directory is <code>storybook-static</code>. Build command use <code>yarn build-storybook</code>.</p>\n<p><img src="/netlify-settings.png" alt="Netlify settings"></p>\n<p>Submit the form to build and deploy the code on the <code>master</code> branch of taskbox.</p>\n<p>When that\'s finished we\'ll see a confirmation message on Netlify with a link to Taskbox‚Äô Storybook online. If you\'re following along, your deployed Storybook should be online <a href="https://clever-banach-415c03.netlify.com/">like so</a>.</p>\n<p><img src="/netlify-storybook-deploy.png" alt="Netlify Storybook deploy"></p>\n<p>We finished setting up continuous deployment of your Storybook! Now we can share our stories with teammates via a link.</p>\n<p>This is helpful for visual review as part of the standard app development process or simply to show off work üíÖ.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Deploy Storybook",description:"Deploy Storybook online with GitHub and Netlify",commit:null},fields:{slug:"/docs/en/deploy/",chapter:"deploy",framework:"docs",language:"en"}},site:{siteMetadata:{title:"binstd-Âå∫ÂùóÈìæ‰∫ëÊúçÂä°Âπ≥Âè∞",toc:["get-started","simple-component","composite-component","data","screen","test","deploy","conclusion","contribute"],languages:["en","zh"],githubUrl:"https://github.com/hichroma/learnstorybook.com",codeGithubUrl:"https://github.com/hichroma/learnstorybook-code",siteUrl:"https://binstd.com"}},pages:{edges:[{node:{frontmatter:{tocTitle:"Composite component",title:"Assemble a composite component",description:"Assemble a composite component out of simpler components"},fields:{slug:"/docs/en/composite-component/",chapter:"composite-component"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{tocTitle:null,title:"Conclusion",description:"Put all your knowledge together and learn more Storybook techniques"},fields:{slug:"/docs/en/conclusion/",chapter:"conclusion"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{tocTitle:null,title:"Contribute",description:"Help share Storybook with the world"},fields:{slug:"/docs/en/contribute/",chapter:"contribute"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{tocTitle:"Data",title:"Wire in data",description:"Learn how to wire in data to your UI component"},fields:{slug:"/docs/en/data/",chapter:"data"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{tocTitle:"Deploy",title:"Deploy Storybook",description:"Deploy Storybook online with GitHub and Netlify"},fields:{slug:"/docs/en/deploy/",chapter:"deploy"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{tocTitle:"Get started",title:"Get started",description:"Setup React Storybook in your development environment"},fields:{slug:"/docs/en/get-started/",chapter:"get-started"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{tocTitle:"Screens",title:"Construct a screen",description:"Construct a screen out of components"},fields:{slug:"/docs/en/screen/",chapter:"screen"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{tocTitle:"Simple component",title:"Build a simple component",description:"Build a simple component in isolation"},fields:{slug:"/docs/en/simple-component/",chapter:"simple-component"}}},{node:{frontmatter:{tocTitle:null,title:"Testing",description:"Learn the ways to test UI components"},fields:{slug:"/docs/en/test/",chapter:"test"}}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"/docs/en/deploy/",framework:"docs",language:"en",chapter:"deploy"}}}});
